Getting started: Included is an Ant-based build. Run ant transform example
xml files to html. The build.xml file itself is excluded.

We need examples, to ensure that we can document them, for all these:
* standard plugins, .e.g., .position()
* standard plugin overrides, e.g., .show()
* selectors, e.g., :focusable
* widgets, e.g., .dialog()
* the widget factory - $.widget, $.widget.bridge, $.Widget
* base widgets, e.g., $.ui.mouse
* easings, e.g., easeInOutQuad
* effects, e.g., pulse
